	<p>
		My story in becoming a software developer began as a child. I was always entranced by automation and computers
		as a whole as I knew that I would love to grow up and be apart of the tech world. Living in the Bay Area I grew
		up around an ever changing technological Mecca and I would see all these videos of headquarters and the great
		things companies like Apple and Facebook were doing and I fell in love.
