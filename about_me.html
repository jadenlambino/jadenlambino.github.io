					<p>
						My story in becoming a software developer began as a child. I was always entranced by automation and computers
						as a whole as I knew that I would love to grow up and be apart of the tech world. Living in the Bay Area I grew
						up around an ever changing technological Mecca and I would see all these videos of headquarters and the great
						things companies like Apple and Facebook were doing and I fell in love.
